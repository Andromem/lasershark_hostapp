r=1000 # Value can range from 1 to the max output as reported by the lasershark (64,000). MUST BE FIRST LINE IN FILE!
# Comment lines start with a # . These are ignored
e=1 # Sets output state. 1 = enable and 0 = disable
#
p=Prints a text string to the console
#
s=1,1,1,1,1,1 # Adds a sample to the sample buffer to be written out.
# The format is x,y,a,b,c,intl_a
# The ranges for these fields are x=[0-4095],y=[0-4095],a=[0-4095],b=[0-4095],c=[0,1],intl_a=[0,1]
# For a and b, 0 means the output is off and 4096 means the output is at full power
# For c and intl_a, 0 means the output is off and 1 means the output is on (for ttl)
# Samples are queued until they fill a full lasershark packet and are then written out to the lasershark.
# This means that to ensure ALL samples are written out, a flush should be performed once all desired samples are 
# written out.
#
f=1 # Flushes all samples. It is reccomended to stick this at the end of your output file to ensure all samples are displayed.
